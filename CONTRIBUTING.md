# Contributing to Psalm

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Psalm, which is hosted in the [Vimeo Organization](https://github.com/vimeo) on GitHub.

Make sure to check out the [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) guide.

## Submitting Issues

You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/new), but before you do, follow these guidelines:

* Make sure that you are using the latest version (`master`).
* It’s by no means a requirement, but if it's a bug, and you provide demonstration code that can be pasted into https://psalm.dev, it will likely get fixed faster.

## Contributing code and documentation

Have a look at the [contributing documentation](docs/contributing/index.md) which is [mirrored on Psalm’s website](https://psalm.dev/docs/contributing).
